"""
Application data management/abstraction layer.  Responsible for:

1) Accessing information from various resources:
* Internal application state  (through local models in models.py)
* External application state  (ORM bindings with other apps, yuck)
* Remote data services (through service adapters in resources.py)

2) Calculating derivative information from existing state:
* Algorithms and data manipulations
* Aggregations
* Annotations
* Alternative data representations

Accepts and returns standard Python data structures (dicts, arrays of dicts)
for easy consumption and manipulation by callers -- the queryset stops here!

When the time comes for remote resources, import the module like so:
if getattr(settings, 'TEST_MODE', False):
    import organizations.tests.mocks.resources as remote
else:
    import organizations.resources as remote
